We were able to answer numerous questions that cover a range of aspects related to absenteeism, employee demographics, and disciplinary actions, providing a comprehensive overview of the workplace situation. Some of the answered questions are as follow:

1. Season with Most Absenteeism: We examined the absenteeism data for each season and identify which had the highest number of reported absences.
2. Month with Second-Highest Absenteeism: Once we identified the second-highest season, we were able to determine which month within that season had the highest number of reported absences.
3. Absences in "Month 0": We looked into the reasons provided for the three reported absences in "Month 0" to understand the cause.
4. Family-Related Absenteeism: We counted the total number of absences categorized as family-related.
5. Highest Code for Family-Related Absenteeism: Identified the code with the highest frequency for family-related absences and how many times it occurred.
6. Employees Classified as Overweight and Obese: We counted the number of employees classified as overweight and obese.
7. Employee Matching Criteria: We searched for an employee who was overweight (not obese), a social drinker, and a social smoker.
8. Absences for the Matched Employee: We determined how many times this employee reported absenteeism and list the reasons.
9. Percentage of Summer Absences: We calculated the percentage of absences reported by the matched employee that occurred during the summer season.
10. Employees with Children and Pets: We counted the number of employees who have at least two children and one or more pets.
11. Absences by Age Group: We analysed absenteeism patterns among employees in their 20s on Mondays and Fridays compared to other days.
12. Disregarded Disciplinary Warnings: We determined the number of employees who disregarded disciplinary warnings and identify the reasons for their absences.
13. High School Education Level: We calculated the percentage of employees with a high school education level among those who disregarded disciplinary warnings.
14. Disciplinary Warnings and Hit Target Value: We determined if all employees with a high school education level and a hit target value of less than 90 disregarded disciplinary warnings.
15. Season with Highest Workload: We identified the season with the highest workload average per day.
16. Employees Absent Only Once: We determined how many employees were absent from work only once and find similarities among them.
